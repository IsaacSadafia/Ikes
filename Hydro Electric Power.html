    <h1>Hydroelectric Power</h1>

<section >
    <p> 
 <strong>Generation:</strong> Hydroelectric power plants harness energy from moving water to generate electricity.
 <br>
 <strong>Components:</strong> Dam, reservoir, penstock, turbine, and generator.
 <br>
 <strong>Process:</strong> Water flows from the reservoir through the penstock, driving the turbine, which generates electricity.

    <h2> Tidal Energy.
    </h2>
    <p> 
 <strong>Generation:</strong>strong>Tidal energy harnesses the power of ocean tides to generate electricity.
 <br>
 <strong>Components:</strong> Tidal barrages, tidal stream generators, or ocean thermal energy converters.
 <br>
<strong> Process:</strong> Tidal barrages capture water during high tide and release it during low tide, driving turbines to generate electricity.

    <h3> Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        1. Renewable Energy Source: Both hydroelectric and tidal energy are renewable and sustainable.
        <br>
        2. Low Operating Costs: Minimal maintenance and no fuel costs.
        <br>
        3. Reliability: Predictable and reliable energy generation.
<h3>Challenges
</h3>
        <p>
            1. Location-Specific: Hydroelectric power plants require suitable geography, while tidal energy needs coastal locations with high tidal ranges.
            <br>
            2. Environmental Impact: Hydroelectric dams can disrupt ecosystems, while tidal energy installations can affect marine life.
            <br>
3. High Upfront Costs: Initial investment costs for hydroelectric and tidal energy projects can be substantial.
