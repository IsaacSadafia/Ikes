<section>
    <p>
  1. Definition: Geothermal energy harnesses heat from the Earth's interior to generate electricity or provide heating and cooling.
        <br>
  2. Source: Heat from the Earth's core, mantle, and crust.
        <br>
  3. Exploration: Identifying areas with suitable geology, temperature, and fluid flow.

    <h2 class="h1">Heat Transfer
    </h2>
    <p> 
 1. <strong>Conduction:</strong> Heat transfer through direct contact between rocks and fluids.
 <br>
 2. <strong>Convection:</strong> Heat transfer through fluid circulation, such as hot water or steam.
 <br>
 3. <strong>Radiation:</strong> Heat transfer through electromagnetic waves.

    <h3 class="h1"> Benefits
    </h3>
    <p> 
1. Renewable: Sustainable energy source.
<br>
2. Low Emissions: Minimal greenhouse gas emissions.
<br>
3. Reliability: Baseload power generation.
 </p>
 <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p> 
1. Location-Specific: Limited to areas with suitable geology.
<br>
2. High Upfront Costs: Initial investment costs for exploration and development.
<br>
3. Induced Seismicity: Potential for earthquakes due to fluidÂ injection.
